## üìå Disclaimer

**Installing a non-official operating system on the Remix Mini PC is done at your own risk. This process may void your warranty, and there is a potential for hardware or software damage. Proceed with caution and ensure you understand the risks before attempting any modifications!**

This guide is based on **Ubuntu 22.04**, but similar steps should work on other Linux distributions.

## **üöÄ Introduction**

The Remix Mini PC was originally an Android-based device but has since lost official support. This guide details how to **revive** the Remix Mini PC by installing an **Armbian-based Linux OS** using **U-Boot and FEL mode**.

The ultimate goal is to make the Remix Mini PC **function like a Raspberry Pi 3**, capable of running a full Linux environment for tasks like hosting a private Git server, running web services, or serving as an office PC.

## **üîß Installation Guide**

### \*\*Step 1: Install \*\***`sunxi-tools`**

Clone the repository and install:

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git build-essential
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/linux-sunxi/sunxi-tools.git
cd sunxi-tools
make
sudo make install
```

### **Step 2: Prepare the Armbian Image**

Flash the downloaded Armbian image to the SD card:

```sh
sudo dd if=armbian.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress
sync
```

üìå **Replace ********`/dev/sdX`******** with your actual SD card device name (e.g., ********`/dev/sdb`********).**

### **Step 3: Prepare U-Boot Side-Loading**

1. Place the SD card into the Remix Mini PC.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory with the **U-Boot binary**.
3. Type (but **do not press Enter yet**):
   ```sh
   sunxi-fel uboot u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin
   ```
4. Hold down the **reset button** on the Remix Mini PC and power it on.
5. **After 5-8 seconds**, release the reset button and **press Enter** in the terminal.

This will **side-load the U-Boot binary into RAM**, allowing the system to boot from the SD card.

### **Step 4: Boot Armbian from SD Card**

If successful, the system will boot into Armbian. Login with:

```sh
Username: Matt
Password: kolbas
```

üîπ **Note:** The **same password** is used for `sudo`.
